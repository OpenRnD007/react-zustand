# React Zustand E-Commerce Store (Lecture)

Welcome to the React Zustand E-Commerce Store! This repository is a comprehensive boilerplate for setting up an e-commerce store leveraging the power of `React + TypeScript`, `Zustand`, and `Cypress`. It encapsulates a suite of components, state management solutions, and hooks that expedite the development of a fully functional e-commerce platform.

## Key Features
